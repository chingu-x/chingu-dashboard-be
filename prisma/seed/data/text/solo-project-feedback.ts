    "Here is some more specific feedback that I hope will be helpful:\n" +

    "This Solo Project is a Tier 1, rather than a Tier 2 app, so you are eligible to join the next Voyage as a Tier 1 participant. You can learn more about our tiers and the requirements of each here —> https://github.com/chingu-voyages/Handbook/blob/main/docs/guides/soloproject/soloproject.md#1-choose-your-tier\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Your repo contains a readme that could be even better with a few changes. This is an important part of any project and here’s additional info to show how to structure a well-written readme. https://medium.com/chingu/keys-to-a-well-written-readme-55c53d34fe6d.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Your commits aren’t atomic, but your commit messages are descriptive. Here’s a guide I think you’ll find interesting & useful for future projects. https://chiamakaikeanyi.dev/how-to-write-good-git-commit-messages/.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "I suggest you move the source code files in the docs directory into the root of your repo in future projects. This directory currently adds an extra, unnecessary directory level to the project and moving it will make understanding the app easier. Here’s some additional info that may be interesting https://dev.to/alexsergey/project-structure-repository-and-folders-review-of-approaches-4kh2\n" +
    "\n" +
    'Your code is readable & maintainable. This is very important since you\'ll spend more time maintaining an app than writing it. I guarantee that in just a few weeks you\'ll forget the details you know today. Anything you can do to improve readability & maintainability is a gift to your ""future self"".\n' +
    "\n" +
    "There is some commented-out code in your source files (such as in docs/app.js). Even though this doesn’t affect the operation of the app it can make troubleshooting and debugging more difficult.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Good use of vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM. This is an important skill to master and one that will help when you start to learn FE frameworks like React, VueJS, SvelteJS, etc.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Your HTML is good, but could be even better by using semantic tags. This is a good best practice to follow since it provides meaning to the elements on the page, which is better than any code comments. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics#semantics_in_html\n" +
    "\n" +
    "UI/UX is clear, concise, & engaging. Here’s a set of principles I hope you will find helpful for future projects. https://www.justinmind.com/ui-design/principles\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Your app is responsive. This is important given the fact that many users rely on mobile devices. Here’s some information that may help you understand this for your future apps https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/responsive/.\n" +
    "\n" +
    "In the browsers console log an error message indicates you have a missing favicon. To correct this you can either add a favicon ( http://www.faviconcodegenerator.com/ ) or suppress the error message ( http://www.faviconcodegenerator.com/prevent-favicon-404-error.php ).\n" +
    "\n" +
    "Consider adding your social & professional links, like GitHub, Twitter, & LinkedIn, to your webpage. This is especially important if you’ll be sharing this app with potential employers. You want to make it easy for them to learn more about you.";
